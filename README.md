# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It allows you to create new lists, add items to lists, and create new foods to be added to lists. Lists are compiled into a grocery list where items can be crossed off.

## Start up

In the project directory, run:
$ npm run server 
to start up the db.json server that acts as a local API

In a new terminal, run:
$ npm install
$ npm start
to open up the front end in a browser
